This is a [Rust][] [workspace][] containing assorted packages for working with
[IRC][] messages and acting as an IRC client.  It was made primarily for
personal use, is not intended for general use, and will likely not be placed on
crates.io.

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org
[workspace]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html
[IRC]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC

The code endeavors to follow the spec at <https://modern.ircdocs.horse>
strictly, including the following points:

- Only the commands and replies documented in the spec are supported (plus the
  nonstandard replies listed below), and only when their parameters follow the
  documented formats (though numeric replies are allowed to have more
  parameters than documented).

- In order to achieve basic compatibility with some actual servers, the
  following nonstandard numeric replies are supported:
    - `RPL_STATSCONN` (250)

- The only supported channel type prefixes are `#` and `&`.

- The only support channel membership prefixes are `~`, `&`, `@`, `%`, and `+`.

- Tags are currently not yet implemented (jwodder/ircbits#4).
